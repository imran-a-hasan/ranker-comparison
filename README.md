# ranker-comparison
One method of voting is to repeatedly select two random options from the list of possible votes, and present them to the voter side by side. The voter is asked to select which
one he or she prefers. This style of voting often leads to contradictions, because an option A may be preferred over an option B, and an option B may be preferred over an
option C, but option C might then be preferred over option A. This projects seeks to determine the best, most efficient, and most accurate way to rank the results of this
type of voting, based on information provided through an Excel spreadsheet.
